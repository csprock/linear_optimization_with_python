    "# Introduction to Linear Optimization in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear optimization (also known as linear programming) is a powerful mathematical technique used to find the best outcome in a mathematical model whose requirements are represented by linear relationships. It's a cornerstone of operations research that helps organizations make optimal decisions when faced with complex constraints and competing objectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a data scientist or analyst, you've likely encountered problems where you need to maximize or minimize an outcome subject to various constraints. Whether it's optimizing a supply chain, allocating resources, or planning production schedules, linear optimization provides a structured approach to finding optimal solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll explore how to formulate and solve linear optimization problems using Pyomo, an open-source Python-based optimization modeling language. Pyomo offers a flexible and intuitive way to express optimization problems and connects seamlessly with various solvers. \n",
    "\n",
    "The example that we will use to motivate our exploration comes from the petroleum industry. There are hundreds of different grades of crude oil in the world, each with different chemical properties. Oil refineries are configured to run using grades whose chemical properties fall within certain bounds. Often, raw crudes from different sources are not suitable for direct use in the refinery, but by blending different grades in the right ratios, a crude oil blend with suitable chemical properties can be created for use in the refinery. \n",
